# Learn_java_basics
you can learn java basic syntax, if you had worked on any another object oriented programming language before! 
just open the main.java in the above files, I have added comments everywhere to make to make it easier to understand

Note: This repo does not contain some concepts of OOPS like polymorphism and inheritance in java, I will add it here soon...
