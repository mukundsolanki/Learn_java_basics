# Learn_java_basics
you can learn java basic syntax, if you had worked on any another object oriented programming language before! 
just open the main.java in the above files, I have added comments everywhere to make to make it easier to understand

Note: This repo does not contain some concepts of OOPS like polymorphism and inheritance in java, I will add it here soon...

This is a Java program that demonstrates the basic syntax and concepts of the Java programming language. It includes variable declaration, user input, arithmetic operations, logical operators, conditional statements, loops, arrays, try-catch method, and functions/methods.

The program begins by defining a function named "sum" that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum. The main function of the program contains various statements and demonstrates the usage of different Java syntaxes.

It declares and initializes variables of different data types such as String, int, double, char, and boolean. It also shows how to take user input using the Scanner class.

The program demonstrates arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, and increment/decrement operators. It also shows the usage of logical operators such as && (logical AND), || (logical OR), and ! (logical NOT).

It includes if-else statements and switch-case statements for conditional branching. It also shows the usage of loops such as while loop and for loop.

The program demonstrates the usage of arrays, including how to declare, initialize and access array elements using loop and for-each loop. It also includes a 2D array example.

It shows how to handle errors using the try-catch method.

Finally, the program defines a function named "sum" that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum. It calls this function and prints its output.
